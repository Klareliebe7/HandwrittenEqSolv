# HandwrittenEqSolv
handwritten equation solver with image input

Goals: handwritten equation solver with image input.

Challenges: handritting image recognition to computer algebra system mobile usability

Profile statistical learning image processing interest in educational technologies (https://www.kom.tu-darmstadt.de/de/teaching/current-courses/labs-projects/kom-lab-project/list-of-topics/)

hello everyone, start to get on working,now there are some reference sources here.

ICDAR conference

Dataset for handwritting https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

CROHME Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressionse2 https://www.isical.ac.in/~crohme/CROHME_data.html


Tutorial of the flow:
There are 3 sections with different options in the same model.
----original version with the expression picture sizes of 128*128 
----dataset changed :to add more data with higher resolution
----model changed : 3cnn 
diese could with different train.py code and different evaluation, so we need to change some name to run the script.
